# Project Title: Content-Based Image Retrieval

### Aim
The assignment project aims to introduce the student to the primary image processing application in leveraging image features such as color, gesture, texture, and shape to retrieve a similar image in the database from the image search.

### Motivation
Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) project serves as an all-in-one solution for an image retrieval problem that may occur when you cannot retrieve images in the relevance of target content. Inspired by the image search in the Google Lens application, which searches the worldwide database of images with similar features from the picture we upload for search. In this assignment, we focus on a small offline database available. The concept of image retrieval is slightly different from image classification. For image retrieval applications, the return result is to find any image with the highest similarity and suggest the result based on it.

### Project Scope
- Utility included in your project would be:
  - Using Matlab or Python only
  - Dataset options (You may use other databases with a minimum of 250 images):
    - [Vegetable Image] - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset
- GUI layout

---
This project aims to familiarize students with content-based image retrieval techniques using Matlab or Python. The provided datasets offer a starting point for experimentation, and students are encouraged to explore additional datasets if needed. The project will involve implementing image processing algorithms to extract features such as color, texture, and shape, and developing a GUI to facilitate image search and retrieval based on user input.
